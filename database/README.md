# Database

The DBMS used in this project is MariaDB 5.5+ or MySQL 5.5+.

* It is recommended to follow the distro's default DBMS (usually MariaDB) on Linux / BSD.

* It is recommended to use MySQL on Windows to get commercial support later.

* It is _not_ recommended to deploy on other OSes.

## Files

* `create.sql` script for creating tables
